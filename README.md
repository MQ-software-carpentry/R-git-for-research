# r-git-for-reserach

Workshop on R and other software tools for researchers, targeted at first-year Higher Degree research students. 
This workshop is amalgamaged from data carpentry workshops for R, spreadsheets, and OpenRefine, and includes applied practice with git-based version control throughout the episodes. 

The purpose of this workshop is to show students a sound research workflow that emphasizes how the different pieces of software interact. The episodes in the workshop are not as standalone as usual carpentry workshops, but they demonstrate how a student might set up a version controlled project, load data into it, and commit changes to data and script files in the process. The focus is on setting up and managing an entire project through R Studio.
